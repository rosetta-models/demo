# Demo Model

The rosetta-models/demo repository is a demonstration project showcasing the capabilities of the Rosetta platform.
It specifically models a subset of the European vehicle emission regulations and is entirely standalone,
not connected to the [Common Domain Model](https://www.isda.org/cdm/) (CDM) in any way.

Key Features:
-	Purpose: Demonstrates Rosettaâ€™s modeling capabilities using a real-world regulatory framework. 
-	Technology: Implemented entirely in Java.
-	Structure: Includes source code (rosetta-source), tests, and configuration files.

This repository serves as a practical example for those interested in understanding how the Rosetta platform can be applied to model complex regulatory requirements
