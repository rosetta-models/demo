# Demo Model

The [rosetta-models/demo](https://github.com/rosetta-models/demo) repository is a demonstration project showcasing the capabilities of the Rosetta platform.
It specifically models a subset of the European vehicle emission regulations and is entirely standalone,
not connected to the [Common Domain Model](https://www.isda.org/cdm/) (CDM) in any way.

Key Features:
-	Purpose: Demonstrates Rosetta’s modeling capabilities using a real-world regulatory framework. 
-	Model: The Vehicle Emissions regulatory model is implemented in Rune.
-	Structure: Includes source code (rosetta-source), tests, and configuration files.

This repository serves as a practical example for those interested in understanding how the Rosetta platform can be applied to model complex regulatory requirements.


## How to release a new version of the Demo Project

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/rosetta-models/demo/releases) page.
2. Click on `Draft a new release`.
3. Make sure the target branch is `master`.
4. In the `Select Tag` box, the latest version will be the top.
5. Increment that [semantic version](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and enter in the `Select Tag` box and click `Create new tag`.
